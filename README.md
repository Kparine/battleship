# battleShip

### Welcome to battleShip (beta branch), let's play!

- This branch (beta), includes several changes not found on master. Including:
	- Updated validation of fire method inputs
	- Updated testing suite
	
- I have included an additional branch, charlie, where I explored building out a more modular OOP approach. This is still under development, as this has been an enjoyable problem to tinker with.
